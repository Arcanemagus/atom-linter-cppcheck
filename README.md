# linter-cppcheck #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Munkei/atom-linter-cppcheck.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Munkei/atom-linter-cppcheck)

A [linter] for [Atom] using [Cppcheck].

## Requirements ##

[Cppcheck] needs to be installed (or at least available). Its path can be
configured.

Without [Linter] this package is rather useless.

## Acknowledgements ##

This package is really a tiny amount of glue between other great pieces of
software, namely the [Linter] package, the [atom-linter] module and — of course
— [Cppcheck].
